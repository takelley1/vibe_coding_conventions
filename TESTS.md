Execute "bash run_tests.sh" until all tests pass.
Investigate the structure of the repository before planning code changes.
If DOCS/ exists, make use of it to search for documentation.
Use ripgrep, grep, ls -R, and find when necessary to search for code.
Plan before making any and all changes.
Think step-by-step before making code changes.
Implement your changes step-by-step and one at a time.
Continue to do this until all tests pass.
Also investigate whether tests are functioning as intended and test the functionality that we want.
Do this by reading docstrings and comparing tests to the code we're testing against.
If your solutions aren't working, try adding debugging.
If necessary, modify run_tests.sh to increase logging verbosity.
If any errors are caused by a library in DOCS/, research the library first before proposing changes to ensure you understand its implementation.
Once tests are passing, remove any extra logging code that was added, and summarize what was performed to fix them.
